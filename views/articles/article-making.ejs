    <h1>The Art of Making</h1>
    <p>The act of creation is what drives humanity forward. It allows individuals to express their thoughts and emotions through tangible forms. In the context of the Graduate Makerâ€™s Market, making transcends traditional boundaries. Students have the opportunity to transform their ideas into reality, creating products that resonate with their passions.</p>
    <p>From handcrafted goods to innovative technologies, the art of making encompasses a wide range of disciplines. This marketplace not only showcases these creations but also serves as a platform for makers to learn and collaborate. By fostering a spirit of creativity, we empower students to explore their potential and contribute to a vibrant community of makers.</p>
